\section{Literature Review}

The literature review is not just about presenting descriptions of the important papers you have found, but telling a meaningful story and, where appropriate, some critical discussion of previous findings (i.e. was another study useful but flawed?). Remember that you may read hundreds of papers/books/web pages etc., but often only about 20 or 30 are really important, and these are the ones you will mention in your literature review, which this report will be a concise version of. This section needs to flow logically, and this does not always imply that the material is chronological. By the end, the reader should have a clear appreciation of what the major work in the field was, why it is relevant to the current project, and where the unknowns and questions lie (\textbf{research gaps}) – these are the issues that you are going to address with your thesis research.

For the purposes of this report, this section will be \textbf{12-15 pages long}. Remember to reference properly any material that you obtain from literature or other sources. If you are unsure how to discuss literature properly, find a really good review paper on your topic, or if there isn’t one, a similar topic, and you will have a good example to refer to.
