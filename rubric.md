| **Pass** | 50–64% | Adequate | Sufficient but incomplete; covers enough to frame project but contains major gaps. |
| **Credit** | 65–74% | Solid | Covers significant literature with no major omissions; conceptual integration missing. |
| **Distinction** | 75–84% | Solid & Linked | Strong review, identifies gaps, demonstrates connections between sources and project direction. |

| **Fail** | 0–49% | Broad context missing | Research question unclear, no feasible plan, lacks thesis outline. |
| **Pass** | 50–64% | Context present, no specific plan | Feasible but lacks detail; generic structure. |

| **Fail** | 0–49% | Insufficient preparations | Little/no evidence of readiness, risk management, or required skill acquisition. |
| **Pass** | 50–64% | Limited preparations | Required elements present but need significant refinement. |
| **Credit** | 65–74% | Solid preparations | Ready to proceed; minimal or no meaningful results yet. |
| **Distinction** | 75–84% | Solid + preliminary results | Demonstrated progress informs project direction. |
| **High Distinction** | 85–100% | Exceptional early progress | Early results already shaping research answers and validating plan. |

## Criterion 4 — Document Presentation

| Grade | Mark Range | Descriptor | Detailed Meaning |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| **Fail** | 0–49% | Impedes readability | Formatting, citation, grammar, or figures so poor that reading is affected. |
